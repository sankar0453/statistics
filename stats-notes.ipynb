    "The CDF is a function that describes the probability that a random variable (continuous or discrete) will take on a value less than or equal to a certain value. It is a mathematical function that describes the probability that a random variable will fall within a certain range of values, up to and including a specific value.\n",

    "In summary, PDFs are used to describe the probability of a continuous random variable taking on a certain value, CDFs are used to describe the probability that a random variable (continuous or discrete) will take on a value less than or equal to a certain value, and PMFs are used to describe the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a certain value.\n",
